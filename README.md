Hello, Im Rina (from Sabrina), a C++/UI/Vulkan/OpenGL/Rocm/CUDA programmer, a mathematician and an open-source developer. Wasted love... wasted memories. The reality itself is non-materialist, containing extra-physics existences underlying the material consequences... God, God is above all of evil meanness existence.

Kisses. 💋🐄🐈‍⬛ In memory of my pets.
